# baby-connect-nightmare

REST API Wrapper around some Baby Connect functionality using nightmare.js.

## Why

I love the [Baby Connect](https://www.baby-connect.com) app. I wanted a 
way to use it from my Pebble, but unfortunately they don't offer an API. 
So I decided to make my own! All it does it provide a few simple commands, 
all triggered via commands run via nightmare.js and PhantomJS. 

## Usage

You'll need to deploy this somewhere to use it. There are lots of 
places to deploy a node.js app for cheap.

Because this isn't a real API, it is fragile and could break anytime the 
baby connect site changes. **So use at your own risk!**

Since you are passing email and password in the POSTs, you'll probably want
to make sure your site uses SSL.

Before you begin, you will need to get the ID of your child out of the 

## Development

Check out the repo and run:
 
`npm install`. 

To start the web server, run: 

`node index.js`.

The API should then be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## API

### Errors

If something goes wrong with nightmare.js, it will return a `500` status and the error, like:

`{ "error" : "This thing went wrong" }`

### KIDS

Gets list of kids in your account with their ids, to be used in other requests.

`GET /kids?email=something@something.com&password=password`
